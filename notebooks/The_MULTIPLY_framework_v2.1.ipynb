    "The MULTIPLY framework is a new toolkit to extract information from remote sensing data. In contrast to other remote sensing software packages, MULTIPLY is designed to consistently use heterogeneous satellite data (coarse vs high, optical vs microwave). Instead of multiple independent process-chains for each individual satellite, MULTIPLY is a single all-in-coupling framework in order to:\n",
    "*\tCreate consistencies between different land surface products (reducing errors in downstream-processing)\n",
    "*\tUtilize the benefits of multiple satellites (including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Landsat), such as \n",
    "    * Higher temporal coverage\n",
    "    * Spectral Sensitivity to more land surface variables\n",
    "*\tQuantify errors of output products, depending on input uncertainties.\n",
    "*\tEnable operational service for different end-users, including: \n",
    "    * Remote sensing consultants\n",
    "    *\tRemote sensing experts\n",
    "In order to achieve these goals MULTIPLY uses a data-assimilation framework developed for the ESA (Gómez-Dans et al. 2016; Lewis et al. 2012). In this framework the state-vector (describing the land surface parameters of interest) are coupled to the observations using radiative transfer models. In addition priori-information (obtained from field-measurements databases) are used to constrain the final results. \n"

    "## 2.1\tRadiative transfer models\n",
    "In it’s most basic description, a radiative transfer model is a model  capable of (using a specific state-vector) as an input simulateing the different interactions of radiation (light) from source (sun/clouds/..) to sensor (satellite ), using a specific state-vector as an input.  Within the model the most important absorption/transmission and reflection processes by different objects (soil/leaf/atmosphere) is characterized. In this regard there exist many radiative transfer models exist, depending on the level and detail of which important processes are taken into account. In practice, highly complex radiative radiative transfer models usually have a high number of input parameters (to describe in detail the 3D structure of the land surface and the full land surface heterogeneity), while less complex models employ specific hypotheses (such as land surface homogeneity) to require less input parameters. \n",

    "While this produces a large variety in radiative transfer models, all of these models have at least one common aspect: they can only be run in ‘forward mode’. This is because completely different scenarios can produce similar remote sensing observations. For example, when a land surface has a very low fractional vegetation cover (~0), different chlorophyll levels will produce similar remote sensing observations."

    "## 2.2\tData assimilation\n",
    "The most common way to circumvent the shortcoming of radiative transfer models is to ‘guess’ the initial state-vector, run the radiative transfer model using this initial assumption, and compare the output observation against the remote sensing measurement, producing an error. By guessing multiple times,  (for instance by constructing a Look-up-Table (LUT), multiple error-values can be calculated. The lowest error-value than represents our best understanding of the land surface (as long as our initial assumption was close enough to the real land surface description). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/CreatingLUTs.png\">\n",
    "Figure 2: Creating LUT tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an LUT approach has the large disadvantage that it only finds values that were used in the initial guessing; for example if for the Leaf Area Index (LAI) only values [0, 1, 2,.. ,6] were used, this retrieval method will not find the (actual) value of 1.22 m2/m2. \n",
    "The shortcoming of the LUT approach can be greatly to a large part be circumvented if the initial scenarios can be updated on basis of the errors found,  (together with taking into account the sensitivity of the model to the state vector), as illustrated by in Figure 3. Such an iterative approach is in general ‘optimization’ of the radiative transfer model. \n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"pics/BasicOptimization.png\">\n",
    "Figure 3: Basic description of Optimization methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, it is possible for the state-vector to ‘slowly’ drift away from our prior-value. In addition, the approach is limited to produce only results for when satellite measurements are being performed. In order to solve these shortcomings additional (prior) information can be used within a data-assimilation framework. This is illustrated by Figure 4.\n",

    "## 2.3\tPrior Information\n",
    "In such an data-assimilation approach, an additional error (Error value 2) different from the observational error (Error 1) is defined, describing the deviation of the state-vector from our initial assumption. Here the observational error is defined in units of the observation (e.q. reflectances [-] or radiances [W sr^(-1) m^(-2) nm^(-1)]), while the prior-error is defined in units of the state vector (LAI  [m^2  m^(-2)], Leaf Angle Distribition [deg], …). In order to reconcile these two into one cost function the errors are normalized. For the observational error this is performed by considering the observational errors, while for the prior information this is accomplished by considering the prior uncertainty (for example the standard deviation of long-term measurements of the respective land surface parameter). This leads then to one single cost-function defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "J_tot=(Error_1)/σ_1 +  (Error_2)/σ_2 =J_obs+J_prior\n",
    "\n",
    "This also immediately provides us with a method on synergistically combining different types of observations, as the observational error can simply be expanded to include multiple observations\n",
    "\n",
    "J_obs=J_obs^1+ J_obs^2+ J_obs^3+⋯\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, each of the error-terms corresponds to different pieces of information added to the system. In this case, even more additional information can also be introduced to the system, be considering the temporal evolution and spatial variation of specific land surface parameters. \n"
